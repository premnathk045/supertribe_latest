## 1. Project Overview

This project is an Instagram-like social media platform designed to facilitate content sharing, discovery, and interaction among users, with a particular focus on creators. The application provides a rich user experience through dynamic content feeds, interactive stories, and dedicated sections for discovering new creators and trending topics.

### 1.1 Core Functionality and Purpose

The primary purpose of this application is to enable users to:
- Share various forms of content, including images and videos, with optional premium access
- Discover new content and creators through categorized browsing and trending topics
- Engage with content through likes, comments, shares, and saves
- Communicate directly with other users via a messaging system
- Manage their personal profiles and view notifications
- Create and share ephemeral stories with advanced editing capabilities
- Authenticate securely using modern authentication flows

### 1.2 Key Features and Capabilities

- **Authentication System:** Complete sign-up/sign-in flow with email verification, password reset, and secure session management using Supabase Auth
- **User Authentication & Profiles:** Users can have profiles with display names, usernames, avatars, bios, and statistics (followers, following, posts). Profiles can indicate verification status, premium status, and online presence.
- **Content Feed:** A scrollable feed displaying posts from followed users, supporting infinite scrolling.
- **Advanced Story Creation:** Professional-grade story creation with camera/video recording, gallery upload, text stories with rich formatting, and real-time preview
- **Stories:** A carousel for viewing ephemeral content (stories) from users, with auto-advance and manual navigation.
- **Post Creation:** A multi-step process for users to create new posts, including media upload (images/videos), rich text content, tagging, and an option to mark content as premium with a set price.
- **Content Interaction:** Users can like, comment on, save, and share posts. Premium content is locked behind a paywall.
- **Discover Section:** Allows users to explore content and creators through categories, trending tags, and a search bar. Creators can be viewed in a grid or list format.
- **Notifications:** A dedicated section to view various types of notifications (likes, follows, comments, purchases), with the ability to mark them as read.
- **Direct Messaging:** A two-pane interface for viewing chat lists and engaging in real-time conversations with other users.
- **Modals:** Various modal components for settings, story viewing, post details, sharing, and authentication.
- **Animations:** Extensive use of animations for smooth transitions and interactive elements.
- **Route Protection:** Secure routing with authentication requirements for protected pages.

### 1.3 Target Users and Use Cases

- **Content Creators:** Users who wish to share their work (art, photography, tech reviews, etc.), build a following, and potentially monetize their content through premium posts.
- **General Users/Consumers:** Individuals interested in discovering new content, following creators, engaging with posts, and connecting with friends.
- **Social Interactors:** Users who primarily use the platform for direct communication and staying updated with their network.
